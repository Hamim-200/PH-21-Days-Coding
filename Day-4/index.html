    <h3>1. What is Git?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1.Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) designed to track changes in source code during software development.</li>
            <li>2.It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>2. Basic Concepts:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Repository: A collection of files and their history, typically representing a project.</li>
        <li>Commit: A snapshot of the project at a specific point in time.</li>
        <li>Branch: A separate line of development that doesn't affect the main codebase until changes are merged.</li>
        <li>Merge: Combining changes from one branch into another.</li>
        <li>Pull Request: A way to propose and discuss changes before merging them into the main codebase.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Git Commands</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>git init: Initializes a new Git repository.</li>
        <li>git clone [repository]: Creates a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.</li>
        <li>git add [file]: Stages changes for the next commit.</li>
        <li>git commit -m "[message]": Records changes to the repository.</li>
        <li>git push: Uploads local changes to a remote repository.</li>
        <li>git pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.</li>
        <li>git branch: Lists, creates, or deletes branches.</li>
        <li>git merge [branch]: Combines changes from another branch into the current branch.</li>
        <li>git log: Displays a log of commits.</li>
    </ul>
